## This article is about the animal.

Otters are carnivorous [mammals][mammals page] in the subfamily _Lutrinae_.  

The 13 extant otter species are all:
* [semiaquatic][semaqua]
* [aquatic][aqua]
* [marine][mar]

with diets based on fish and invertebrates. _Lutrinae_ is a branch of the _Mustelidae_ family, which also includes weasels, badgers, honey badgers, martens, minks, polecats, and wolverines. 

## Description

Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from 0.6 to 1.8 m (2.0 to 5.9 ft) in length and 1 to 45 kg (2.2 to 99.2 lb) in weight. The Asian small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water.

Several otter species live in cold waters and have high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. European otters must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as 10 °C (50 °F), an otter needs to catch 100 g (3.5 oz) of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for three to five hours each day and nursing mothers up to eight hours each day. 

## Species

2. [North American River Otter](#North-American-River-Otter)
3. [Sea Otter](#Sea-otter)

## European Otter

The **European otter** (_Lutra lutra_), also called the **Eurasian otter**, inhabits **Europe**, most of **Asia** and parts of **North Africa**. In the **British Isles**, they were common as recently as the 1950s, but became rare in many areas due to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, habitat loss and water pollution (they remained relatively common in parts of Scotland and **Ireland**). Population levels reached a low point in the 1980s, but are now recovering strongly. The **UK Biodiversity Action Plan** envisages the re-establishment of otters by 2010 in all the UK rivers and coastal areas they inhabited in 1960. Roadkill deaths have become one of the significant threats to the success of their re-establishment.

## North American River Otter

The North American river otter (_Lontra canadensis_) became one of the major animals hunted and trapped for fur in **North America** after European contact. River otters eat a variety of fish and shellfish, as well as small land mammals and birds. They grow to one meter (3 to 4 ft) in length and weigh from five to 15 kilograms (10 to 30 lb).

In some areas, this is a protected species, and some places have otter sanctuaries that help sick and injured otters to recover.

## Sea otter

Sea otters (_Enhydra lutris_) are classified as marine mammals and live along the Pacific coast of **North America**. Their historic range included shallow waters of the **Bering Strait** and **Kamchatka**, and as far south as **Japan**. Sea otters have about 26,000 to 165,000 hairs per square centimeters of skin, a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction. By the time the 1911 Fur Seal Treaty gave them protection, so few sea otters remained that the fur trade had become unprofitable. Sea otters eat shellfish and other invertebrates (especially clams, abalone, and sea urchins). Otter populations are affected by the density of prey they hunt. Because the otter food source is easier to excavate from rocky-bottom habitats, as opposed to soft-bottom habitats, more otters tend to live in waters with rocky bottoms with access to shallow-burrowing prey. They frequently carry a rock in a pouch under their forearm and use this to smash open shells, making them one of the relatively small number of animals that use tools. They grow to 1.0 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) in length and weigh 30 kg (66 lb). Although once near extinction, they have begun to spread again, from remnant populations in **California** and **Alaska**.

Unlike most marine mammals (such as seals or whales), sea otters do not have a layer of insulating blubber. As with other species of otter, they rely on a layer of air trapped in their fur, which they keep topped up by blowing into the fur from their mouths. They spend most of their time in the water, whereas other otters spend much of their time on land.
